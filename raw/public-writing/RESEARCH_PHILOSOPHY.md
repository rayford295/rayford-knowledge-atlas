<a id="introduction"></a>

This project begins with a simple but enduring belief:

That **ambition gives direction**,  
that **courage sustains exploration**,  
and that **reading is often the first act of serious thinking**.

Long before models, benchmarks, or systems, research starts with curiosity —
a willingness to question what is known, to read deeply, and to imagine what might be possible.
Books, papers, and ideas encountered through reading do not merely transmit knowledge;
they quietly shape how we see the world, how we frame problems,
and how far we are willing to think beyond established boundaries.

Pursuing research, especially in emerging fields such as GeoAI and AI4Science,
requires a particular kind of courage:
the courage to cross disciplines,
to work at the intersection of geography, artificial intelligence, and Earth system science,
and to accept uncertainty as an essential part of discovery.

This repository is built not only as a collection of resources,
but as a reflection of a research journey guided by **intellectual ambition**,
sustained by **curiosity and courage**,
and continuously refined through **reading, learning, and critical reflection**.

What follows is both a map of ideas and an invitation:
to read carefully, to think spatially,
and to explore how autonomous intelligence can deepen our understanding of the Earth and its complex systems.<br>
很抱歉我会用我的母语（中文）来写我的研究哲学，翻译是极其简单的事情。如果你渴望了解，请翻译。

### 🇺🇸 English Version

**Be Concise.**  
If you can explain a concept in 5 words, do not use 10. Some information has been repetitively mentioned throughout the manuscript — sometimes even in the same paragraph.

**Be Clear.**  
You may have a deep understanding of many important concepts, e.g. GenAI, LLM, and LVM, but the challenge is to explain these concepts clearly to reviewers/readers. Good scientific writing is not about using many related terms; it is about explaining ideas in a way that is precise and easy to follow.

**Be Organized.**  
Please pay close attention to the logical flow across paragraphs and within each paragraph. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to follow the structure of your writing and reorganize it into a more coherent order. A well-organized manuscript makes it much easier for readers to understand your argument.

**Be Specific.**  
This paper discusses the use of GenAI in disaster resilience. The introduction just needs to cover four parts, and every paragraph should be specific in answering the questions in each part:
1. What is disaster resilience, and why is it important?
2. What are the challenges in disaster resilience research?
3. What is GenAI, and why is it promising in addressing the challenges in disaster resilience research?
4. What does this paper want to achieve (objectives)?
5. *(Optional)* The organization of this book chapter.

**Be Meticulous.**  
As you grow into an independent scholar, it is important to pay closer attention to details in your writing. I can revise the manuscript for you, but you will learn much faster by working through these issues yourself. This takes time and effort, but it is one of the most valuable skills you can develop for your academic career and beyond.

**Be Focused.**  
I know you are working on many tasks at the same time, and that is an impressive ability. However, when you are working on a paper, try to focus on shaping it into a piece of work that meets your own standards. Deadlines are important, but they should not come at the cost of quality. Rather than trying to do as much as possible, aim to produce work that has as much impact as possible.

**Be Positive.**  
My critical comments are to help you become an independent scholar — scientific writing is hard, and I am still trying to improve my writing every day. By the time you graduate, you should become a better researcher than me.

<a id="disaster-resilience"></a>

## What is disaster resilience? What are the major/important tasks in disaster resilience? What are the data/model challenges in supporting these tasks?

From a geographical perspective, disaster resilience is essentially the spatiotemporal adaptability of a Human-Environment System. It involves three environments and three types of systems: the natural system (climate, topography, ecology), the built environment (cities, transportation, electricity, buildings), and the social system (population, economy, governance capacity). Disaster resilience refers to the ability of a socio-ecological-infrastructure system to withstand, adapt to, recover from, and sustain itself in the face of natural disasters. Simply put, it answers four questions: Can it withstand a disaster? How will it respond when a disaster strikes? How quickly can it recover after a disaster? And can it become stronger in the future?

Disaster resilience typically revolves around the disaster lifecycle:
1. Risk Identification
Goal: Identifying where disasters are most likely to occur and who is most vulnerable.
2. Monitoring & Early Warning
Goal: Detecting disasters as early as possible and issuing early warnings.
3. Damage Assessment
Goal: Quickly assessing the impact of a disaster.
4. Emergency Response
Goal: Rapidly deploying resources for disaster relief after a disaster occurs.
5. Recovery & Adaptation
Goal: Restoring social systems and reducing future risks.

Disaster research data presents several typical challenges:
1. Multi-source data
2. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity
3. Data scarcity
4. Noisy data

Model Challenges
1. Multimodal Integration
2. Multi-scale Problem
3. Generalization
4. Explainability

<a id="genai"></a>

## What is GenAI? What are the common types/applications of GenAI, and why are they potentially powerful in disaster resilience research and disaster management (think about the monitoring, mapping, modeling, management, and mitigation framework)? How can GenAI/GenGeoAI support tasks to improve disaster resilience?

First, we need to understand that the main tasks of traditional AI are classification, prediction, and detection. Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of AI technology that can learn data distributions and generate new content. Its core capability is naturally generating new content, including but not limited to images, text, and video. Common techniques include Large Language Models (LLMs), Diffusion Models, and multimodal generative models such as vision-language models.

I believe GenAI has main characteristics, which are also summarized in Dr. Zhongzheng Tu's course: GenAI can generate more content (data); it has cross-modal capabilities (visual language capabilities; and reasoning, which can be used for explanation).
Main Types and Applications of GenAI. In real-world applications, GenAI can be broadly categorized into five types:

1. Text Generation: 
Automatic report generation, disaster information summarization, policy analysis, and emergency decision support.
Example: Automatically summarizing disaster information from social media.

2. Image Generation:
Models: GAN, Diffusion models
Applications: Disaster scenario simulation, data augmentation, virtual training data generation.
Example: Generating flood or fire scenarios for model training.

3. Multimodal Generation:
Image understanding + text interpretation and cross-modal reasoning.
Example:
Analyzing street view images and generating disaster damage descriptions.

4. Synthetic Data Generation:
Applications: Few-shot learning, data augmentation, simulating extreme events.
Example: Generating rare disaster data.

5. Simulation/World Models:
Applications: Disaster evolution simulation, urban system simulation, complex system prediction.
Example:
Simulating wildfire spread or flood propagation.

Disaster research typically involves five aspects: monitoring, mapping, modeling, management, and mitigation.
GenAI has potential in all of these areas.
1. Monitoring
GenAI can:
Automatically analyze satellite imagery
Automatically interpret the street view image
Automatically summarize social media

2. Mapping
GenAI can help:
Automatically generate disaster maps
Automatically identify damaged buildings
Automatically update geographic databases


3. Modeling
GenAI can:
Build complex system models
Simulate disaster propagation
Predict disaster impacts


4. Management
GenAI can assist in:
Emergency decision-making
Resource allocation
Risk communication

5. Mitigation
GenAI can help with:
Urban planning
Risk prediction
Climate adaptation

GenAI's key advantages in disaster research lie in 1) multimodal understanding capabilities, 2) few-shot learning capabilities, 3) automated knowledge generation, and 4) complex system simulation capabilities. My current research shows that GenAI supports three key tasks: disaster perception, disaster reasoning, and disaster diagnosis. This is also the core idea behind my multi-agent disaster system.

<a id="case-studies"></a>

## Case studies (it is important to think about how each case study reflects/represents the potential of GenAI/GenGeoAI in supporting disaster resilience improvement tasks)

Case Study 1: Disaster Monitoring Using Social Media + LLM (Bing Zhou) 
During disasters, a vast amount of information spreads rapidly through social media. Generative artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), can automatically analyze and summarize this textual information, extracting the location, type, and extent of the disaster. For example, the model can identify flood or fire-related information from social media posts and generate real-time disaster summaries. This approach transforms dispersed social media information into a "social sensing system," thereby improving the speed and coverage of disaster monitoring.

Case Study 2: Disaster Mapping Using Remote Sensing Imagery or Street View + GenAI (Yifan Yang)
Rapidly assessing damage after a disaster is crucial for emergency response. Generative artificial intelligence can combine remote sensing imagery and computer vision models to automatically identify damaged buildings, flooded areas, or road disruptions, generating disaster loss maps. For example, by analyzing pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery, the model can detect changes and create a damage distribution map. This automated disaster mapping technology can significantly improve the efficiency of disaster assessment and provide vital spatial information support for the allocation of relief resources. The same approach can be used for street view imagery. We can generate street view images from remote sensing images and then perform ground sensing.

Case Study 3: Disaster Scenario Simulation Using Generative Models (Debayan Mandal)
Generative artificial intelligence can also be used to simulate different disaster scenarios, thereby supporting disaster risk prediction. This can also be considered digital twins. For example, generative models can simulate flood diffusion processes under different rainfall intensities, or wildfire spread paths under different wind speeds. By generating multiple possible disaster scenarios, researchers can assess risk changes under different environmental conditions. This scenario simulation capability is of great significance for understanding the dynamic processes of disasters and developing disaster prevention strategies.


Case Study 4: GenAI Supporting Disaster Management Decisions (Ali Mostafavi or Zihui Ma)
During disaster emergency response, decision-makers need to quickly understand complex and constantly evolving information. Generative artificial intelligence, especially large language models, can integrate multi-source data from remote sensing imagery, social media, sensors, and official reports, and automatically generate disaster reports or decision recommendations. For example, the model can summarize the main problems in the affected area and propose rescue priorities or resource allocation plans. This technology helps managers understand the disaster situation more quickly, thereby improving the efficiency of emergency management.

<a id="challenges"></a>

## Existing challenges and future opportunities

While the application of GenAI/GenGeoAI to disaster resilience research and management holds immense potential, it also presents a series of challenges and significant development opportunities. Let's delve into some new aspects beyond the familiar ones.

First, significant challenges remain regarding data. Data is gold, data is oil. Disaster data often suffers from multi-source heterogeneity, large differences in spatiotemporal resolution, and data gaps. For example, remote sensing imagery, street view images, social media information, and sensor data vary significantly in format, quality, and update frequency, making multimodal data fusion difficult. Furthermore, some disaster events are low-frequency but high-impact, resulting in limited data samples available for model training, thus affecting the stability and generalization ability of the generated models. Data uncertainty and data quality have a significant impact on the results. My thinking is to become a researcher who creates comprehensive data. We should avoid generating one type of data from another, as this has a series of subsequent drawbacks. Can we simulate the entire process, creating a world model? In this way, all the scientific phenomena within the data are accessible.

A very important signal appeared in 2026: people have started to truly send generative AI and compute nodes into space. The first AI-generated image created in orbit is not merely a media story. It suggests that the computational infrastructure of spatiotemporal intelligence is itself expanding spatially — from 天数地算, to 天数天算, and further toward 天地同算. This is highly relevant to my research interests. It means that remote sensing and disaster intelligence may no longer depend entirely on sending raw observations back to Earth for processing. Instead, sensing, compression, recognition, generation, and even preliminary reasoning may happen in orbit.

This changes how I think about missing data. In the future, the question may not simply be how to fill gaps by borrowing one modality to compensate for another, but how to transform “missingness” into problems of delayed inference, cross-view reconstruction, or process simulation. In that sense, satellites may evolve from passive sensors into autonomous computational nodes with perception, reasoning, and task-execution capabilities. If that happens, world models and digital twins will no longer be only ground-based simulation frameworks; they may become hybrid infrastructures jointly supported by terrestrial and orbital computing systems. For GeoAI, this means that space computing is not far away from our field — it may become part of the next-generation foundation of disaster response, spatiotemporal intelligence, and autonomous science.

Second, model reliability and generalization ability remain key issues. Generative models can generate misinformation or "hallucinations," and in high-risk decision-making environments like disaster management, this uncertainty can have serious consequences. Furthermore, many models are trained on data specific to a particular region or disaster type, thus limiting their applicability across different regions or disaster scenarios. Therefore, I've been considering the current level of zero-shot models, which is why I created agent4disaster—to examine the most basic capabilities of existing models.

Third, interpretability and decision-making trust are also significant challenges. Disaster management involves multiple stakeholders, including governments, emergency agencies, and the public; therefore, model outputs not only need to be accurate but also explainable in their reasoning. If a model cannot clearly explain the basis of its predictions or recommendations, decision-makers may find it difficult to trust or adopt these technologies. Humans naturally distrust non-human content, especially AI capabilities, and there is currently anxiety surrounding AI. This will inevitably lead to a large amount of content attacking AI, even if AI makes fewer mistakes than humans, because when it does, the responsibility is difficult to assess.

In addition, ethical and data governance issues also need attention. For example, social media data may involve privacy issues, and content generated by generative models may also pose a risk of misleading information. Therefore, applying GenAI in disaster research requires establishing a transparent and responsible data governance framework. This is where mutual visibility comes in, as we discussed earlier. I believe that mutual visibility mechanisms can address privacy issues to some extent.

GenAI, or AI in general, currently has two main paths: one is the general model, the world model—a large model that brute-forces solutions to all problems; embedding is a very good example, and there are increasingly more papers on it. The other is the agent—small and specialized, solving each small problem with capabilities far exceeding those of humans and existing models.

Overall, AI is disrupting everything, and we need to use AI as quickly as possible, research AI, and understand the essence of problems. We should boldly raise questions and then use engineer-like thinking to iterate rapidly.

<a id="geoai"></a>

## What is GeoAI?

GeoAI is a very complex concept, and we can interpret it from multiple perspectives. The difficulty lies in the fact that this interdisciplinary concept is hard to break down clearly. 

Why do we need to interpret it? Because whenever we propose a new concept, such as Responsible GeoAI or Fiduciary GeoAI, we need to first explain what GeoAI is. Before attempting to explain GeoAI, there are a few questions. First, what is the difference between GeoAI and AI for GEO-related Science? Considering other fields like biology, physics, and chemistry—hard sciences—we rarely hear it named BioAI, PhyAI, or ChemAI. It's more often called AI for Science. The core difference is: AI for Geo = AI as a tool to solve geospatial science problems. GeoAI = a new methodological system formed by the integration of AI and geospatial science. Therefore, my current research is more focused on AI4Science, specifically due to the breadth and inclusiveness of the GeoAI concept. My research can also be considered a part of GeoAI. GeoAI focuses on, but is not limited to, spatial autocorrelation, spatial heterogeneity, spatiotemporal processes, geographic scale, and proximity relationships—these are theoretical structures unique to geography. However, this is also a part that my current research lacks.

Therefore, if I had to summarize my current research, it would be Autonomous/Responsible/Fiduciary AI for/in disaster assessment. I consider disaster assessment to be part of geographical research. Disaster assessment uses computational tools to abstract complex information and simplify it to geographic information suitable for mapping.

Therefore, I'm also thinking about my future, even a ten-year research plan. I believe that using AI as a tool, AI4science, might be a research direction I excel at, and also an extension of my current path. AI4geography problems can always be studied, and can also be considered as the research content of geoAI. However, this type of research is always limited by AI. Similar to AI scientists discovering better models or algorithms, I apply them to my field. I'm more like an applied scientist, which is also my current role. Considering the special nature of geographical data, we can always publish papers in this way, although the impact of their work is limited. Secondly, there's cartography. Maps are one of the most special products with geographical characteristics. AI + mapping will involve a lot of engineering and ethical issues, which I'm very interested in. How to define the next generation of AI + cartography, and how to conduct entirely new research beyond AR, VR, and other technologies. Robotic cartography will change the role of cartographers in the future. But how humans interact with maps is also a very good question. Human-computer interaction in maps also requires geographical thinking. Just like Apple's products are superior to most brands, there are actually many research questions to consider. 

Finally, there's process modeling, which can also be understood as spatiotemporal intelligence, world models, and digital twins. I really like the concept of spatiotemporal intelligence because, in my view, time + space equals geography. My current research doesn't fully utilize the characteristics of time, even though we can consider pre- and post-disaster periods as spatiotemporal. Remote sensing is one of the best research subjects for spatiotemporal intelligence. I believe the greatest significance of spatiotemporal intelligence and world models lies in attempting to solve the problems of missing data and uncertainty. If we can continuously simulate the entire process of an event, then we can naturally discover its correlations and predict the future. Taking remote sensing-generated street-view as an example, if we use a world model to simulate the entire process of a hurricane's disaster, then we only need to capture remote sensing images and street-view images from different perspectives. The problem of missing data no longer exists; only angles are needed. Therefore, video generation is currently a path to solve this problem. I've also seen Dr. Wenwen Li use video models to predict wildfire planning. Similarly, I think audio models may also attempt to address seismic waves.

The emergence of in-orbit AI generation and space-based computing makes this direction even more exciting to me. If satellites can not only observe but also compute, recognize, generate, and reason in orbit, then spatiotemporal intelligence may no longer be limited to Earth-based data centers. A future world model for disaster science may be distributed across ground systems and orbital systems at the same time. In that case, “remote sensing-generated street-view” is no longer only a cross-view generation problem; it becomes part of a larger computational ecology in which missing ground perspectives might be reconstructed, inferred, or pre-processed before they even return to Earth. This is why I think 天地同算 is not just an engineering story, but a conceptual shift in how we understand the infrastructure of GeoAI and AI4Science.

Spatiotemporal intelligence is currently the most exciting research topic for me.


Returning to GeoAI, the mainstream explanations currently include Esri's explanation, the GeoAI tool developed by Dr. Qiusheng Wu, and Dr. Song Gao's manual explanation. GeoAI usually refers to Geospatial Artificial Intelligence. The core understanding is not as simple as "using AI on maps," but rather truly combining AI's learning ability with the spatial thinking of geography/GIScience, enabling machines to handle questions such as "where is it, why is it there, what are the nearby relationships, and how will it change over time."

Therefore, I prefer to understand GeoAI as having three layers. We can be considered GeoAI as long as we make contributions at any of these three levels.

The first layer: The data layer.

GeoAI deals with geospatial data, such as remote sensing imagery, street view imagery, trajectories, POIs, road networks, topography, meteorology, social media, population, and socioeconomic data. This data is often multi-source and heterogeneous, and it includes coordinates, time, and scale. A key value of GeoAI is that it puts this originally scattered data into a unified spatial framework for learning.

The second layer: The methodology layer.

GeoAI uses machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks, spatiotemporal prediction, generative models, and visual language models, but the focus is on "spatialization." For example, remote sensing feature recognition, flood/fire detection, traffic prediction, site selection optimization, urban functional zone identification, and environmental exposure estimation are not merely simple classifications; rather, they enable the model to understand spatial structure and spatiotemporal processes.

The third layer: The science and decision-making layer.

Truly mature GeoAI not only achieves high accuracy but also supports geographic knowledge discovery and real-world decision-making, including disaster response, urban governance, ecological monitoring, public health, and infrastructure planning. Recent papers have also emphasized that GeoAI should not only focus on "task-oriented benchmarks" in the future, but should move towards stronger cross-modal reasoning, scientific discovery, interpretability, and ethical governance.

<a id="dissertation-positions"></a>

## Dissertation Research Positions: Six Core Questions

*The following reflects my considered responses to foundational questions raised during preliminary examination review. These are not definitive answers but working positions — subject to revision as the research matures.*

---

<a id="q1"></a>

### Q1: What is the biggest contribution of your dissertation? Is it proposing, testing, or designing an autonomous GeoAI algorithm/architecture/framework?

I see the biggest contribution of this dissertation not as proposing a single isolated algorithm, but as systematically proposing and progressively validating an autonomous GeoAI framework and architecture for post-disaster multimodal geospatial intelligence. More specifically, its main contribution is architectural and conceptual, rather than the design of any one standalone model.

The five case studies form a clear developmental trajectory, moving from bi-temporal classification to multimodal arbitration, then to cross-view generation, multi-agent autonomous reasoning, and finally spatial equity evaluation. In that sense, the dissertation is organized as a progressive framework-building effort rather than a collection of disconnected papers.

If I had to choose among proposing, testing, and designing, I would describe the core contribution as **proposing and progressively testing an autonomous GeoAI framework**. Agent4Disaster is the most concentrated expression of that framework, but the earlier case studies establish the theoretical, methodological, and empirical foundation that makes it possible.

<a id="q2"></a>

### Q2: What is the novelty of your work? What are the theoretical innovations?

The novelty of this dissertation lies in three main aspects. First, it moves beyond single-modality, passive damage classification by integrating street-view imagery, satellite imagery, textual descriptions, and socioeconomic variables into a unified multimodal GeoAI research framework. Second, it introduces cross-view generative synthesis by exploring whether post-disaster street views can be generated from satellite imagery, thereby addressing the critical bottleneck created by the lack of ground-level imagery immediately after disasters. Third, it advances toward a zero-shot, end-to-end, multi-agent GeoAI pipeline that enables continuous capabilities in perception, restoration, recognition, and reasoning, rather than simply producing a classification label.

In terms of theoretical innovation, I see three major contributions as well. First, the dissertation moves Responsible GeoAI from a largely principle-based discussion toward an operational and evaluative methodological framework by embedding interpretability, trustworthiness, and transparency into disaster workflows through Grad-CAM, CLIP-based arbitration, and LLM reasoning. Second, it proposes a progressive scientific pathway for Autonomous GeoAI, moving from passive recognition to active generation and then to autonomous reasoning, which offers a more systematic theoretical structure for autonomous geospatial intelligence in GIScience. Third, it introduces spatial equity as a core evaluation dimension in disaster GeoAI, shifting the focus beyond accuracy alone and incorporating fairness, spatial inequality, and environmental justice into model assessment. This has clear theoretical significance for both GIScience and Responsible AI.

<a id="q3"></a>

### Q3: Is damage assessment the only goal of the autonomous GeoAI pipeline? Can we use the proposed GeoAI to accomplish more disaster-related tasks?

No. Damage assessment is the central application domain of this dissertation and the main thread that organizes the overall research, but it is not the only goal of the autonomous GeoAI pipeline.

According to the design of Agent4Disaster in the proposal, the system is intended not only for damage recognition but also for hazard identification, workflow planning, degraded image restoration, object-level damage detection, bi-temporal change analysis, and the generation of structured reports with causal explanations and recovery recommendations. In addition, the fifth case study extends the model outputs to questions of spatial equity and resource allocation.

In this sense, the dissertation moves GeoAI beyond a damage-classification tool toward a broader disaster intelligence framework that can support post-disaster assessment, explanation, decision-making, and recovery.

<a id="q4"></a>

### Q4: How does your work contribute to AGI or geo-foundation models?

This work is not directly aimed at building general AGI, so I would not describe it as a general intelligence project. However, from a forward-looking perspective, it does provide an important building block for AGI and geo foundation models in the geospatial domain.

Many foundation models remain at the level of representation learning or single-step prediction, whereas my work seeks to move them toward a more agentic pipeline in which the system can perceive across modalities, fill cross-view information gaps, transfer across hazard types in a zero-shot setting, and generate reasoning-based reports through multi-agent collaboration.

For geo foundation models, the significance of this work lies in showing that geospatial foundation models should not be limited to remote sensing classification alone, but should evolve toward autonomous reasoning, zero-shot transfer, and end-to-end geospatial decision pipelines. In that sense, I would position this dissertation not as AGI itself, but as helping advance the evolution of foundation models toward autonomous intelligence in the geospatial domain.

### Q5: How to ensure that your work will still be useful/usable in the next 5-10 years?

I believe this work will remain useful over the next five to ten years, not because any single model will necessarily remain state-of-the-art, but because its contributions operate at the architectural, task, and evaluation levels.

First, the framework is modular. The perception, restoration, recognition, and reasoning components in the multi-agent structure can all be updated as new models emerge, so the system is not tied to any one short-lived model. Second, it emphasizes multimodality, cross-view learning, cross-hazard transfer, and zero-shot adaptation, all of which offer more lasting value than achieving high accuracy on a single benchmark dataset. Third, the proposal highlights open datasets, model weights, and the AutonomousGeoAI4Science community platform, which strengthen reproducibility and long-term usability.

Finally, the dissertation incorporates interpretability, trustworthiness, and spatial equity into system design, and these dimensions are likely to become even more important in future AI governance and public-sector deployment. In other words, even as specific foundation models continue to evolve, the Responsible and Autonomous GeoAI framework proposed in this dissertation should remain extensible, replaceable, and broadly usable.

### Q6: How should I frame the dissertation contributions after advisor feedback?

After another round of discussion, Dr. Zou suggested that my dissertation can be framed through four possible contribution areas:

1. **Innovative GeoAI/GenAI models and pipelines**
   This includes multimodal and multi-temporal geospatial modeling, agentic GeoAI workflows, and geo-foundation-model-enabled downstream geospatial tasks.

2. **Advanced GeoAI/GenAI applications in disaster resilience**
   This includes damage assessment, monitoring, strategic recovery support, and other tasks that enhance disaster resilience across regions and hazard scenarios.

3. **Improved understanding of resilience mechanisms**
   This refers to what kinds of buildings, neighborhoods, infrastructures, and communities are more resilient, and how these factors interact spatially.

4. **Critical reflections on GeoAI/GenAI theories, governance, and practices**
   This includes responsible, fiduciary, and trustworthy uses of GeoAI, especially in contexts where people increasingly accept decisions made by AI rather than decisions merely assisted by AI.

I agree with this framing, but my current view is that the first two are the strongest and most central contributions of my dissertation, while the fourth provides an important normative and philosophical layer. The third is a meaningful long-term direction, but at present it should be stated more cautiously unless my work directly explains resilience mechanisms rather than only supporting resilience-related tasks.

My current understanding is that existing disaster resilience research, especially disaster assessment, often suffers from strong regional dependence, limited generalizability, unimodal data, and analytical pipelines that remain passive and overly tied to fixed workflows. These limitations are closely related to the geographic nature of disasters, because disaster resilience tasks are inherently multi-stage, multimodal, multi-scale, and highly uncertain, while also involving complex human-environment interactions. For this reason, I do not think that a single model or a single-step prediction framework is sufficient to support a more realistic form of geospatial intelligence for disaster resilience.

In my view, multi-agent systems offer a more appropriate path forward because they enable complex disaster tasks to be organized into multiple interrelated spatial intelligence tasks and addressed through role differentiation and coordinated execution, in a way that more closely reflects the real structure of disaster processes. Foundation models provide the underlying multimodal capabilities for understanding, generation, and reasoning, but my main contribution lies not in the foundation models themselves.

Rather, my main contribution lies in designing and validating a **multi-agent GeoAI framework for disaster resilience**, including the definition of agent roles, collaboration logic, and the responsible selection and use of models for different tasks. Generative AI is what makes such a system feasible, while my role is best understood as that of a **system architect**, organizing multiple AI units with different capabilities into a geospatial intelligence system capable of carrying out key disaster resilience tasks. In this sense, the researcher acts as the system designer, supervisor, and evaluator, while different agents serve as specialized computational units within the overall geospatial workflow.

Building on Dr. Zou's summary, I therefore see my dissertation as contributing primarily in two areas:

- **Innovative GeoAI/GenAI methods and pipelines**, especially through the design of multimodal and multi-agent workflows for complex geospatial tasks
- **Advanced GeoAI/GenAI applications in disaster resilience**, especially for damage assessment, explanation, and decision support

At the same time, I also see an important supporting contribution in **critical GeoAI thinking**, because responsible, fiduciary, and trustworthy AI are not secondary concerns in my work, but core design principles. What makes this dissertation distinctive is that it sits at the intersection of geography, disaster resilience, and AI. Compared with a purely computer science perspective, I am in a better position to define agent roles in ways that reflect the real structure of disaster resilience problems. Compared with a purely domain-oriented perspective, I am in a better position to understand what kinds of problems AI can realistically help solve, and how multimodal models, generative AI, and agent-based systems can be organized to support those tasks.

My long-term goal is to develop an autonomous, extensible, and generalizable agentic GeoAI system that can adapt to new study regions, new hazard scenarios, and new downstream tasks. In this sense, even as AI continues to become more powerful, the roles of agents will continue to evolve rather than disappear.

## 读书笔记（真金）

用发展的眼光看问题，这是一份终身职业，一份与你的一切不能分割的工作，有意义的失败远远比无意义的成果的有价值。狠狠地操练自己，你越强，找到你的观众越多。而不是你能讨好的人越多，你的观众越多。炸场是副产品，正如名利也是副产品。人是目的，不是手段。--《李诞脱口秀工作手册》

好好活就是做有意义的事，做有意义的事，就是好好活。
早熟的人吧，通常都晚熟。骄傲的人又很性急。

竞技体育唯一的意义就是赢，因为每一个队都有勇气，热情和热爱。正如张艺兴在极限挑战说的一样，只有赢，游戏才好玩，才爽。剩下的一切都是安慰的借口罢了。--《观u23亚洲杯决赛有感》

古人之观于天地、山川、草木、虫鱼、鸟兽，往往有得，以其求思之深而无不在也。夫夷以近，则游者众；险以远，则至者少。而世之奇伟、瑰怪，非常之观，常在于险远，而人之所罕至焉，故非有志者不能至也。有志矣，不随以止也，然力不足者，亦不能至也。有志与力，而又不随以怠，至于幽暗昏惑而无物以相之，亦不能至也。然力足以至焉，于人为可讥，而在己为有悔；尽吾志也而不能至者，可以无悔矣，其孰能讥之乎？此余之所得也！--《游褒禅山记》

"我心中有一团火焰，它离我很近，我却摸不到；

害怕并不代表没有勇气，真正的行动才是最重要的。一个人究竟是英雄还是懦夫，由行动决定。
领导力是一种能让别人追随你的能力，即使别人只是出于好奇。
视角的不同会令世界上所有重大事件的意义彻底发生改变，这令我惊叹不已。--《创业维艰》

如今回头看，这段生活对我而言，不啻为一种幸运。我在监狱中学会了乐观。在那以前，我一直以为自己生活在社会最底层。经历过无可比拟的绝望。但是在狱中，我懂得了所谓悲观与乐观都是相对的。--李明博

生活是属于每个人自己的感受，不属于任何别人的看法。--余华

我现在正在做的事情是对的吗？如果是错误的，我有勇气立刻停止吗？--段永平投资问答录

建立停止清单，本质上是一种通过"做减法"来聚焦的智慧。人的精力和资源是有限的。--段永平投资问答录

本分不是一种束缚，而是一种保护。它像是一道防火墙，将那些致命的风险、诱惑和错误决策隔绝在外。--段永平投资问答录

段永平对国内的情况非常了解，他觉得中国人敢于打拼，最大的优点就是勤劳朴实，但在打拼的过程中，他们可能会将精力全部投入工作，忽略了对生活的享受。当支持人问他希望给年轻人什么样的忠告的时候，他想了想，这样说道"如果一定要说，那就是享受生活，这是人来到这个世界上的目的。"--段永平投资问答录

怀有平常心的段永平，敏锐地意识到新时代的企业家和投资者可以有理想，也可以有追求，但更应该学会把握现实。毕竟理想主义者是走不远的，因为这样的人往往好高骛远，同样，那些纯粹的现实主义者很难将业务做大，因为这种人只看重眼前的利益，没有大格局和战略目光。一个出色的企业家应该是将现实主义与理想主义的有机结合，能够以平常心看待发生的事，能够依据事物的本来面目去做事，不违背规律和现实。--段永平投资问答录

互见性强调双向透明的责任制。透明性必须是双向的，作为一个"透明人"，我必须能够了解所有搜集我的信息并且观察我的机构，知道我自己的评分，还要有申诉的途径。他们能看到我，我也能看到他们。同样，责任必须是双向的。如果我不同意，觉得不公平或者系统出错，那我有权进行申诉。如果这一切完全是单方面的，我不会接受。它必须在某种程度上具有对称性。例如，如果对机构好处过多，对个人则不够，就会出现问题。--2049，未来10000天的可能。

在镜像世界中，互见性至关重要，我们必须确保搜集信息的系统自身的行为是公开且透明的。申诉和举证的权利也很重要。镜像世界是一个万物互联的世界，一旦遇到纠纷，需要有机制能调用所有记录个人行为的数据。举个例子，我走过了一条黑暗小巷，如果那里停着车，车载传感器搜集了我的行为数据，我就应该有权获取这些数据。我们需要一种机制，以便在出现纠纷的时候，能够调用所有搜集的信息，重现实际发生的情况。最后，为了加深互见性，还需要有两项保障性举措，一是设立隐私区，二是建立合理的上诉机制。--2049，未来10000天的可能。

"透明"的世界并不是说完全没有隐私，每个人都可以要求建立自己的隐私区。例如，智能手机时代的"不插电"运动，或者说断网，但大多数人可能不会选择这种方式；另一种更可行的选择是，信息搜集的结果只保存在本地，从不与外界共享，并且有明确的协议对此进行规定。人们也可以在公共空间设定专门的区域，在这些区域中不会进行任何信息搜集，比如一个不搜集任何信息的公园。就像在公共浴室或更衣室中不能使用手机一样，当你进入这样的区域时，你要摘下智能眼镜，完全退出镜像世界。--2049，未来10000天的可能。

所以在未来的镜像世界中，大多数情况下每个人都是"透明人"，随时随地被搜集信息。他们之所以会选择允许个人信息被搜集，是因为他们信任这个镜像世界，相信这是一个有互见性的世界，谁在搜集什么信息完全公开透明，每个人都有权利访问关于自己的任何信息，特别是在涉及法律问题时。每个人都有公开透明的申诉途径，系统必须有纠错机制。此外，这将涉及大多数人在透明与隐私保护之间的权衡。所以这一过程是渐进的，只有当大多数人从透明的社会中获得更多定制化的服务和福利时，他们才会选择让渡大部分隐私权。--2049，未来10000天的可能。

观察富人现在在做什么是我预测未来的一个重要方法。--2049，未来10000天的可能。

我经常说一句话：生产力是为机器人而设的，而不是为人类而设的。任何有生产力指标的工作，都不应该由人类而完成，未来尤其如此。而创新和创业的过程中充满了死胡同，充满了失败，都是非常低效的。而这恰恰是未来人类需要花更多时间去做的事情。--2049，未来10000天的可能。

众生平等，不是说众生都有一样的价值，而是说众生都一样没有价值。--《笑场》

因果循环，报应不爽，说的不是你种了善因你就要得善果，种了恶因你就得恶果。种了善因，一定会有善果，只是善果不一定会报在自己身上，恶因也是一样。为了善果才种的善因，还叫善因吗？众生皆苦，诸法无常，好人也是众生，也是无常。一个人死了，就是死了，没有因果好说的。--《笑场》

你光想永远也想不明白，就得做。完成比完美更重要。我相信科学，我最近一年学习科学的成果是，发现人类就是为别人活的，这是人之所以为人的原因。这个其实是市场经济的观点。标准是有的。人是活出来的，不是想出来的，你照着标准去想没用，只能活。纠偏，纠正，把自己当成一个人工智能活，拿自己在世界上跑程序，跑出bug就修一修。我想说的是，不要享受忧伤。我觉得忧伤不牛，悲凉也不牛，牛在于你真的做出东西来。如果说创作作品的话，牛在于你真让人喜欢，让人开心，我觉得这些是有价值的，享受忧伤，底色悲凉都是自我感动。--李诞

AI已经把思想生成的成本压低到几乎为零，就像互联网曾经把通信成本压低到几乎为零一样。这是一件了不起的事，但它本身并不直接创造“丰盛”。瓶颈已经转移了。我们进入了一个人们可以为某个科学问题瞬间生成数千种理论的时代。接下来真正的挑战是：验证，评估与筛选。这要求我们彻底改变科学的组织结构。传统上，我们靠的是设门槛。在AI生成内容泛滥之前，虽然也有业余科学家提出各种宇宙理论，但大多数价值极低且数量可控。因此我们建立了同行评审和发表体系，用来过滤信息，筛选出高价值的想法加以检验。但现在，AI可以大规模生成各种可能的解释，其中一些是好的，但大量是糟糕的，甚至是幻觉的。人类评审员已经不堪重负。--陶哲轩  --感悟：品味和做什么真的极其重要

如果没有经纬度标准，我说我在这里，你说你在那里，现代社会的人类生活将无法想象。但是，地球并没有经纬度，这只是人为制定的游戏规则。你能说地球的经纬度是科学规律吗？肯定不是。

康德认为事物在进入我们的认识领域时就被我们的认识能力进行了建构。康德把哲学从追求世界本质转到了我们能够认识什么，理解什么，限制了知识的范围。这就是为什么有人说康德哲学是一场哥白尼式的革命。因为在康德看来，我们只能认识世界的现象，世界的本质不可知，甚至世界背后根本就没有本质。知识是主体通过理知，概念主动构建和创造的。所以，康德提出了“人为自然立法”的思想。

省略和简化有助于我们进行理解，但很多时候会让我们的理解出错，因为我们所理解的内容或许只是有缩略者精心归纳的概念，而不是纷繁宏大的现实，而它才是主观抽象所得出的概念的本质。但是生命是短暂的，而信息是无穷的：没有人能够有时间去成就一切。在实践中，我们总是被迫在过分简略的阐述和无法进行阐述之间做出选择。简略是必要的恶，缩略者的任务就是尽可能做到最好，虽然在本质上不好。--美丽新世界

我一直喜欢拿 RAM 膨胀来说事--1969 年，64kb 的内存把阿波罗号送上了月球；2026 年，我打开一个网页，500MB的内存开销轻轻松松。每一代硬件工程师拼命把内存做大，然后每一代软件工程师肆意挥霍，拼命把它塞满。大家已经习惯了这个循环，甚至觉得这就是进步的正常代价。

未来不仅是企业之间的算力战，更是超级计算机与一座座实体城市之间的能源争夺战。为了让虚拟世界里的 AI 模型多推演出一行代码，现实世界里的某个街区可能就必须面临限电。解法是“太阳能+电池”。而在这一领域，中国是绝对的规则制定者。从西北漫山遍野的光伏矩阵，到占据全球压倒性份额的储能电池供应链。最令人振奋的是，中国无可匹敌的重工业制造与落地执行力。中国过去几十年积累的庞大碳基基础设施，恰恰是孕育未来最强硅基智能的最完美的摇篮。如果说电力和变压器是制约 AI 躯体的物理枷锁，那么人类产生的优质数据，就是决定 AI 能否跨越“智力总和线”的认知口粮。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

真正能让 AI 产生智力跃迁的，是高质量数据--人类历史上所有出版的书籍，同行评审的学术论文，高质量的开源代码，维基百科以及专业论坛的深度讨论。马斯克的超级计算机巨人虽然拥有 10 万颗 GPU 的胃口，但人类现有的智慧结晶，已经不够它吃了。既然人类写的太慢，那我们就用旧的 AI 来生成海量的新数据，去喂养下一代的新 AI。这就是被称为“合成数据”。然而，这种看似能够左脚踩右脚上天的永动机模式，在严谨的科学实验面前，撞上了一道名为“模型崩溃”的铁臂。这就是学术界的“数字近亲繁殖”。ai 生成的内容到了第五代就已经偏离了基本事实，到了第9 代，模型彻底崩溃，吐出的全是一堆毫无语法，毫无逻辑的乱码。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

大语言模型的本质，是概率统计。它在学习人类语言时，会本能的去捕捉那些“最常见，概率最高”的表达方式，而无情地裁剪掉那些“低频，生僻，特立独行的”人类边缘表达。如果用这些已经被抹平过一次的数据去训练第二代 AI，数据的多样性就会锐减。这就如同把一张复印件再拿去复印，一代接一代，图像的细节会不断丢失。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

人类之所以聪明，是因为我们的社会充满了不可预测的“熵”，突如其来的灵感，犯错后的顿悟以及不可量化的情感。在这样一个高度同质化的“数字玻璃房”里，模型的进化曲线必然会走向停滞，最终退化为统计学上的白痴。由于人工智能工具的普及，今天的互联网已经充满了被 AI 批量生成的劣质文章，机器翻译，和流量垃圾。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

当 AI 把全人类的图书馆都吞噬殆尽后，就只能靠咀嚼自己的排泄物来维生，那个孟菲斯机房里的超级智能，最终也只能在数字的近亲繁殖中，变成一个语速极快，患有严重幻觉的疯狂复读机。杨立昆则认为：“别说超越全人类了，目前最聪明的大语言模型，甚至还不如你家里养的一只宠物猫。” 以 ChatGPT 为代表的大语言模型，其底层逻辑叫做“自回归”。用通俗的话来说，它们的工作原理本质上一场极其复杂的“概率填空游戏”。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

为了把这个复杂的计算机科学概念解释清楚，我们不妨借用武侠小说中“招式”与“内功”的区别。你只要在键盘上敲出上半句，它就能瞬间通过概率库算出你下一招要使出的是“亢龙有悔”还是“见龙在田”，它用文字打出的每一套剑法都标准，华丽到了极致。但是，它毫无“内功”。在金庸的小说中，真正的高手之所以能无招胜有招，是因为他们对真气的流转，对人体的经脉，对周遭环境的风吹草动有着极其深刻的底层感知。而在 AI 领域，这种底层感知被称为“世界模型”。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

一个人，他只有对未来有更多的信心，才会对现在有更多的耐心。--王兴传

帕金森法则认为，任务的重要性和复杂程度与所分配的完成任务的时间密切相关。如果给你 24 小时去完成一项任务，时间的压力促使你集中精力去执行，别无选择只能做最重要的部分。--每周工作四小时

学会视而不见是获得内心平静的重要途径之一。--罗伯特 索耶

不是积聚而是精简。不是每天增加而是每天减少。文明的程度总是向着更简单的方向变化。--李小龙

未来的终极形态，必须是“神经网络”与“符号逻辑”的完美结合。这就是被称为 AI 皇冠上明珠的神经符号人工智能。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

人类历史上曾经历过三次极其惨痛的自恋创伤。第一次创伤，是哥白尼用日心说粉碎了人类在空间上的神圣特权。地球根本不是什么宏大戏剧的中心舞台，我们不过是无垠深空里一粒悬浮在阳光下的微尘，是一颗围绕着普通恒星旋转的边缘行星。我们在浩瀚宇宙中的绝对优越感，第一次被击碎了。第二次创伤，是达尔文用进化论撕碎了神创论的特殊滤镜，剥夺了人类作为生物的至高无上。人类并非神明特意打造的宠儿，我们只是一群在物竞天择的残酷法则，侥幸褪去体毛，直立行走的灵长类动物。当我们不得不接受自己与黑猩猩共享着同一个远古祖先时，那种超越万物的神圣光环黯然失色。第三次创伤，是弗洛伊德用精神分析学说，击碎了人类引以为傲的绝对理性。在那幽暗深邃的潜意识海底，翻涌着难以启齿的欲望，恐惧和本能的暗流。用来，我们甚至连自己大脑的绝对主宰都不是，理性的王座瞬间摇摇欲坠。每一次的自恋创伤，虽然都粗暴地将人类从自以为是的中心位置踹下来了一点，但随之而来的，却是人类文明无与伦比的爆发与成长。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

每一次自尊的崩塌，都是一次文明的破茧成蝶。每一次我们交出某种虚妄的特权，宇宙就会补偿我们一种认识世界，改造世界的真实力量。当我们面对人工智能带来的第四次自恋创伤。当硅基大脑越过全人类智慧的总和，剥脱我们最聪明实体的头衔时，我们或许也可以超越自身的恐慌和失落。当我们承认机器在计算，逻辑和海量信息处理上远胜于我们，当我们不再需要解题速度，记忆力和代码产量来证明自己存在的价值时，人类也就从长达数千年的脑力竞赛中彻底解放出来。它逼迫我们放下对智力的傲慢痴迷，转而向内在去探寻意识的终极奥秘，去拥抱感知，创造力与爱的纯粹力量。在一场远比过去任何一次都更加无与伦比的成长中，人类将重新定义何为“人”。真正稀缺且具有无限价值的，恰恰是人类的“不完美”。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

尼采给出过这样的箴言，一个人内心拥有混沌，才能诞生出一颗飞舞的星。ai 是那道提出了一切混沌的完美方程式，但人类的价值，就在于保留了这部分混沌。机器的算力追求绝对的正确，而人类的灵魂包容美丽的错误。正是这些看似低效的熵，构成了宇宙中最动人的创造力。ai 迫使我们从长达数千年的脑力异化和枯燥劳作中解脱出来，去直面一个被我们遗忘已久的事实：我们本就不是为了做完美的齿轮而生。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

哲学家或许可以尽情讨论 ai 时代人类灵魂的混沌之美，但资本和算法可没有耐心等待人类完成这场漫长的精神重构。未来将不再有工作是注定的。你可以为了个人的满足感而去工作，就像一种爱好，但人工智能和机器人将能够做所有的事情。

在当前的时代版本下，做东西的门槛太低了，创始人倾向于直接开干，做出一堆没人要的产品。AI 时代创业，最稀缺的资源从能不能建变成了该不该建。判断力取代了执行力，成为创始人最核心的竞争壁垒。--AI Native 创业手册

公平有时也是一种特权，只有强大的人才能享受到这种特权。“你看过《动物庄园》吧？里面所有的猪都是平等的，但一些猪比另一些要更加平等。”--Odin

在北欧神话中，奥丁为了喝一口智慧之泉的泉水，献祭了自己的右眼。“I see wisdom at any cost. 为了获得智慧和力量，你必须 sacrifice（牺牲）很多东西：亲情、爱情，甚至是世俗的圆满。--Odin

Odin说，他人生有三次的大的转变：认识到靠父母不如靠自己；认识到靠老板不如靠自己；认识到靠亲密关系不如靠自己。

Odin曾在访谈中引用尼采提出的“主人道德”：真正的主人道德，不是让人自我克制、退缩或放弃，而是不断进取和创造。

“你有没有想过，为什么开国皇帝都是马上皇帝？”Odin突然问我。然后又自答式地说，“因为不能只有vision，还得身先士卒。”“创业就是造反。”Odin说，具体点说就是：革上一代AI for Science的命。

“去美国想寻找那群玩世不恭、给众生带去美好的愿景的嬉皮士。但去了发现，美国早已没有嬉皮士了。那个时代过去了。”对于“出家”，Odin现在的说法是：“佛法在世间，不离世间觉。离世觅菩提，犹如求兔角。”

“如果你最终成功了，那个会是个怎样的世界？”“一个充满创造力的世界，创造的权力重新归还到执行者手中。”“假如失败了呢？”“我不是真的想成功，我只是想更自由地失败。”

独立思考。做下棋的人，而不是棋子。--拉尔夫 沙瑞尔

开会是一种令人上瘾并沉浸其中的活动，无论公司还是其他组织都习惯于开会，只是因为他们自己不能独立解决问题。--戴夫巴里

马斯克韦伯在《新教伦理与资本主义精神》中写道，为了驱动庞大的资本主义机器，工作被赋予了极其强烈的道德与宗教色彩。它不再是单独的劳作，而变成了一种神圣的天职。努力工作，创造财富成为了一个人获得救赎与尊严的证明，而懒惰则被刻画为不可饶恕的原罪。从那时起，人类的作息被强行与机器的运转频率对齐，一整套坚不可摧的工作伦理被建立起来。当你向一个陌生人介绍自己时，第一句话永远是我是一名老师，我是做金融的，我是程序员。你是谁？你做什么工作。这两个问题在现代化语境下被画上了绝对的等号。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

社会学家齐格蒙特鲍曼在《工作，消费主义与新穷人》一书中，极其冷酷地揭露了这层温情脉脉的面纱：所谓神圣的工作伦理，从头到尾就是一场为了匹配大机器生产而精心设计的“规训与剥削”。工作伦理本质上是一场深度成功，深入骨髓的剥削。我们的悲哀与今天面临的尴尬处境，恰恰在于：我们再过去这三百年的资本主义狂飙中，被剥削得太深，太彻底了，以至于我们全人类都患上了文明级别的斯德哥尔摩综合症。我们亲手阉割了自己建立独立身份的能力。现代人的身份，完全是依附与职业这个“社会插槽”而存在的。职业不仅仅为你提供支付账单的薪水，它还为你锚定日常的作息结构，规划你的社会阶层，提供同济的社交网络，以及最致命的--它提供“你正在被这个世界需要”的成就反馈与虚假的安全感。我们从未学过如何在没有老板，kpi，公司头衔的情况下定义自己的价值。我们这具碳基肉身，早已被异化成了系统上的一个零件，一旦脱离了运转的机器，就剩下一堆无处安放的废铁。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

现代思想家尤瓦尔赫拉利，在《今日简史》中，抛出了一个令人不寒而栗的论断：未来将产生一个极其庞大的无用阶级。他所定义的，不是传统社会学意义上的“贫困阶级”，也不是经济周期被动下产生的“失业阶级”，而是对整个宏观经济流转和国家机器运转而言，彻底没有用途的人群。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

过去的资本主义秩序之所以还能维持某种博弈结构，是因为资本仍然需要劳动力。而一旦你不被经济系统所需要，你的经济权力也就随之归零。而一旦人的经济权力被瓦解，生存就从契约权力变成了社会的施舍。当人工智能和机器人把大多数工作干完，人类必须有一种“脱离就业”的生存保障体制。于是未来人们的经济收入主要依靠每个月政府或系统发放的维生资金。UBI，本质上精英阶级为了防止社会动荡，防止你因为绝望而成为社会的无用阶级。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

赫拉利预言，未来社会将依靠两大支柱来维持稳定：一是依靠系统或政府发放的全民基本收入来维持人类的生理存活。二是依靠极度沉浸的虚拟现实与电子游戏来填补人类的精神空洞。在这条路径下，人类将无底线地沉浸在由 AI 实时生成的完美虚拟宇宙中。在那个没有现实重力，有求必应的数字乌托邦里，多巴胺被算法极其准确地计算与操控。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

社会学家齐格蒙特鲍曼在《流动的现代性》中曾发出过深刻的警告：”现代人有一种强烈的本能，想要逃避一切沉重，持久且充满摩擦的社会关系，转而追求一种轻盈，无负担的流动。人类“社会肌肉”的萎缩循环便与 ai 创造的虚拟世界的理念一拍即合。我们在现实世界中越是脆弱，社恐，就越会无可救药地依恋 AI 元宇宙提供的虚拟安慰。我们对于快乐的感受，从来都不是一个稳定的建筑，而是一个极速坠落的递减函数。早在 1971 年，心理学家菲利普布里克曼和唐纳德坎贝尔就提出了著名的享乐跑步机理论。该理论指出，无论人类获得了多么巨大的外部奖赏，哪怕是中了彩票巨奖或是搬进了梦想中的豪宅，我们在经历了短暂的狂喜后，大脑的快乐基线最终都会无可避免的回落到原点。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

正如弗洛伊德所说，人的欲望，本质上是有压抑和缺失产生的。而被完全满足的欲望，会瞬间失去作为欲望的资格。不断加码，为你量身定制更加极端的超常刺激。但这注定是一场饮鸩止渴的恶性循环，最终导向的是快乐阈值的全面崩塌以及情绪感知机制的彻底失效。人类的尊严，成就感以及一个确凿的自我，也必须依附于某种真实的阻力才能成型。因此，我们必须找回被冒犯的勇气，允许他人不理解你，从而找到自身真实的边界。其次，我们需要重建对于艰难的耐受力，在认知的深水区碰撞作为“精神实体”的他者。我们要主动阅读那些充满认知摩擦力的长篇巨作，去看海明威笔下那座藏在冰山之下的克制与残酷；去体会曹雪芹在草蛇灰线在埋下的，需要极大的耐心才能理清的命运线索，去咀嚼张岱在繁华落尽后对世俗幻想的苍凉审视；去詹姆斯乔伊斯，佛吉尼亚伍尔夫的意识流中艰难跋涉。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

马斯克用拉丁语极其命名为“向星”（Ad Astra），取自那句著名的古罗马谚语“Per aspera ad astra”--历经坎坷，终抵星辰。传统的学校就像是一条枯燥的工业流水线。他们把孩子按制造年份分批次塞进车间，强迫他们学习那些随时可以从互联网上搜索到的标准答案。这本质上是在把人类训练成一台劣质的计算机。这套教育体系还要溯源至 18 世纪晚期，刚刚在拿破仑铁蹄下遭遇惨败的普鲁士王国，为了迅速实现国家机器的复兴，发明了这套机具军事化色彩的国民教育模式。它的初衷并不是为了启迪民智或培养独立思考的灵魂，而是为了大批量，高效率生产出绝对服从命令的士兵和顺从的国民。这场教育模式的演进与轰轰烈烈的第一次工业革命完成了历史合流。再过去三百年里，为了匹配大机器生产对绝对秩序的极度渴望，人类在全球范围内复制并升级了这套体系，建立了一座座极其高效的齿轮制造机局。其实只要稍微审视一下传统学校的运转逻辑，你就会发现它与福特汽车的流水线如出一辙。这套教育体系的核心目的只有一个，通过标准化的教材，毫无弹性的统一考试和严苛的纪律规训，对鲜活的个体进行系统性的削峰填谷。它将人的特异性，野性与对权威的质疑视为系统冗余。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

价值理性的本质，是不计较得失与成败，而是出于对某种伦理，信仰，公平或人类尊严的绝对敬畏，去做出选择。大模型的运转是建立在降熵的基础上，它通过吞噬海量数据，寻找规律，剔除噪音，最终输出一个确定性的，最优的数学解。而真实的人类社会则是永远处于一种充满摩擦与变量的高熵状态。在这个高度复杂的系统里，任何单纯基于效率和利益的数学评估，都存在着极其致命的局限性。在高熵的现实中，利益的计算往往会陷入死胡同，因为彼之蜜糖，往往是甲之砒霜；短期的局部最优，往往意味着长期的全局崩溃。逼迫他们在生计与生态的惨烈置换中，学会在伦理的泥潭里做出艰难的妥协，去承担决策带来的道义重压。马斯克比任何人都知道，这种在高熵的混沌中建立规则，缝合共识的能力，比任何超级算力都无法代劳。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

它不生产任何直接的物质财富，其存在的全部目的，仅仅存在于活动本身，也就是哲学上所说的“以自身为目的”。在这个状态下，过程即是终点，体验即是奖赏。人类讲故事的核心图腾，一定会从征服与效率转向真实的神圣性。在未来，我们不再有竞争和征服的必要，人类会重新讲述什么是英雄，什么是勇敢。勇敢，不再是开疆拓土，或者在虚拟的赛博幻境里呼风唤雨；真正的勇敢，是敢于拒绝虚拟的安逸，而主动选择留在粗糙的，充满摩擦的真实世界。真正的英雄是那些宁愿忍受漫长且笨拙的沟通，去承担被误解，被背叛的巨大撕裂感，也要去全心全意拥抱一个充满瑕疵的同类的人。人类的衰老，疲惫，情绪崩溃和必死的宿命，将不再被视作是耻辱，而是我们能够彼此链接的密码：正是因为我们在物理上是会受伤的，所以我们交付给彼此的信任才显得重若千钧；正是因为我们的生命时间是单向流逝且极其有限的，所以我们陪伴彼此度过的时光才变得神圣不可侵犯。--2030倒计时：马斯克预言 AI 取代人类

当我到达高处便发觉自己总是孤独，无人同我说话，孤寂的严冬令我发抖，我在高处究竟意欲何为？
自从厌倦于追寻，我已学会一觅即中；自从一股逆风袭来，我已能抗御八面来风，驾舟而行。--超兽武装

周瑜兵败，乃叹曰：“深感人生之艰难，就像那不息之长河，虽有东去大海之志，却流程缓慢，行程多艰。然江河水总有入海之时，而人生之志，却常常难以实现，令人抱恨终身！“ 小乔慰其曰：“将军英才盖世，辅佐明主，渴望统一大业却属鲲鹏之志。然涓滴之水汇成江河，已属不易，奔流向前，汇入大海之时，更会倍感自身之渺茫。“--周瑜和小乔

动笔太早，无人问津；落笔太迟，这场拐点的权威叙事便会旁落他人。--哈萨比斯传

千万不要在你没有兴趣的领域追求成功。因为你得跟那些真正有兴趣的人竞争，他们在自己有兴趣的领域都是疯子。--兰斯伯格

一台超人类计算机不仅仅是实现科学目标（推动科学认知进步）的手段，它本身可能就是目标。因为在计算机科学的助力下，信息才是现实的基本单位。只有信息才能为解释所有经验事实提供基础，粒子的行为，能量的流动，甚至人类的意识，都可以被视为信息处理的例子。侯世达认为，生物学本质上一个信息处理系统，定义生命的不是肌肉或组织，而是赋予它们生命的信号。克劳德香农关于信息的理论：信息如何被量化，存储和在时间与空间中传输。--哈萨比斯传。

信息是不确定性的对立面。从这个角度来看，任何不确定性的减少都依赖于经过智能处理的信息。“万物理论”，也就是一种能将不确定性无限趋近于零的理论，极有可能以计算机程序的形式呈现。如果信息是构成现实的基本单位，那么在此基础之上又是什么呢？对香农来说，答案是计算，即处理信息，传输信息并从中获取意义的过程。--哈萨比斯传。

对我来说，科学是一种精神追求。哈萨比斯说道。也许精神追求就是与宇宙建立联系。每当我试图理解宇宙时，我都会有这种感觉。打造AI对我来说意义深远，因为它将帮助我理解宇宙，实现我的人生目标。上帝存在于自然之中，所以理解自然是一种精神追求。--哈萨比斯传。

对于孙正义来说，他必须是第一。--押注的男人

根据公司的一项非正式指导原则，只要某个软件项目有机会影响10亿用户，谷歌就会支持这种真正宏大的冒险。--哈萨比斯：谷歌AI之脑

尤斯塔斯解释说，他正在开发一项秘密的地图功能。用户只需点击鼠标，就能从普通地图切换到新颖的3D视图，然后在社区里进行虚拟漫步。这个项目需要从空中拍摄大片实景区域，尤斯塔斯和他的工程师们已经自制了镜头来捕捉必要的图像。为了保守秘密，尤斯坦斯需要将这些镜头安装在自己的机队上。--哈萨比斯：谷歌AI之脑

如果我们发表论文，就能宣称自己是世界第一。黄士杰催促哈萨比斯。不，不行。哈萨比斯反驳道，我们的目标不是成为世界上最好的程序，而是击败人类顶尖职业选手。黄士杰认为这个抱负过于遥远，他想先拿下这个阶段性成果，而不是冒险追求更大的成功。黄士杰向西尔弗抱怨，他一遍又一遍的说道，这是不可能的。黄士杰后来回忆道，阿杰，这才是项目的意义所在。黄士杰在攻读博士学位时，就已经开发出一款击败所有其他程序的系统，重复同样的成就毫无意义。--哈萨比斯：谷歌AI之脑

吾幼时好棋，名震乡野，人皆谓神童。年岁稍长，遇一山野老道，三天对弈，终得一胜。老道愿赌服输，施展法术，通天遁地。吾顿生神往，遂弃棋修道。可惜吾天赋一般，只求兢兢业业，苦心钻研，不惜远家人、抛爱侣、弃友人，漂泊四海，无所依绊。几经险境，半生贫苦，老来方有定所，可惜时日无多。近来常思：人生百年，蜉蝣一日，长生于我何有哉？不过又入樊笼尔。不若二三好友，弈棋饮酒，良缘佳侣，人间携手，风光百年，同归尘土。但问道之心，终归难改，纵使蹉跎一生，也要争那一线天机。只因幼时便知，人生如棋，落子无悔！--凡人修仙传

今天突然特别有感悟。什么是幸福？有的人认为，和风细雨是幸福。有的人认为，知足常乐是幸福。但我却不这么认为。容易满足的人总会看不到前进的方向，只能原地踏步。人的一生只有几十年，为什么要庸庸碌碌？所以我的幸福感来自于贪婪，唯有贪得无厌才是人前进的动力。才能带给我们美妙的成就感，更好地感受这个世界。因为我们的目标应该是星辰大海。--龙王传说，唐家三少

世界杯的决赛结束之后，必有一方欢欣鼓舞，也有一方黯然泪下。过去的阿根廷队身上总是有一种悲情的气质，踢得好看，但是华丽，不过总是不能走到最后，有时甚至早早出局。这届比赛，阿根廷队，他们厌烦了红颜薄命的这种故事，开始回归铁血精神。他们明白艰难的生活并不浪漫，踏实地活着才是最高明的艺术。他们已经放弃了华而不实，对自己完成了革命，要知道对讲求完成地阿根廷人来讲，这样地革命是多么地痛苦。也许只有拿到了大力神杯的那一刻，所有的努力和隐忍才有回报，但是他们现在就差一步。就如那首著名的阿根廷作曲家所谱写的探戈舞曲《一步之遥》一样。奖杯就在眼前，他们自己的面孔都已经印在了杯身上，呼吸甚至都触摸到了杯座。但是却只差一步，探戈舞曲当中，与生俱来的悲情气质和阿根廷的气质真是有些暗合，挥之不去，就像宿命一样。你爱上一件事物，当然不是爱她的成败，你爱的就是她的气质。--2014巴西世界杯，贺炜

彼得·蒂尔说过一句挺刻薄的话：“竞争是失败者的游戏。”聪明人应该想办法绕开竞争，而不是加入一场已经很激烈的战局。他喜欢的方法是从0到1——用技术创新直接跳出竞争的框架，去做一件别人还不会做的事。

1985年，郭广昌考上复旦，第一志愿填了哲学。理由是商业是“低层次的事情”，有志向的人应该“修身齐家治国平天下”。这个想法现在听起来有点今夕何夕，太过理想主义色彩，但它背后藏着一个重要的训练：哲学系最核心的东西，是在所有人都认为某件事理所当然的时候，停下来问一句：真是这样吗？放在商业里，这个习惯有个很具体的用法。当一个赛道很热，同时发生着两件事：一，那个方向是真实有价值的；二，那个方向已经被市场充分定价了。

郭广昌曾把自己的方法论浓缩成一句话：“做对的事，做难的事，做需要时间积累的事。”表面上看像是心灵鸡汤，可仔细琢磨一下，会发现他这句话讲的是一套非常硬核的商业逻辑。这三件事放在一起，有一个隐藏的结果——凡是“难”的、“需要时间”的，参与者天然会少。 因为人的本能是趋利避难、趋快避慢，越难的事，中途撤退的人越多；越慢的需要时间完成事，等不下去的人越多。

AGl是收益最大的。那其他事情，如果有精力，我们会做，没精力，我们就不做。克制是我们愿景里的一部分。我喜欢的叙事是“一群平凡的人做出了不平凡的事”，而不是“一群天才做出了不平凡的事”。开源和低价，让员工觉得很有成就感，组织因此有凝聚力，对社会有好处，其他同行和普通人都会很高兴。所以这种克制，从远景上来讲，能够增加我们做成AGI的概率。

大概二十年前，我在管理上最崇拜的是杰克·韦尔奇(GE的前CEO)。现在来看，他说的大部分东西可能都已经不对了，但是他有一点说对了:一个公司最重要的是愿景。愿景不是挂在墙上的标语，不是怎么说，而是怎么做。

中美AI的差距主要在资源上。我们相信Scaling，肯定是规模越大，效果越好。训练这么大的模型，并不是因为我觉得这么大的模型就够了，而是因为只有这么多资源。人才几乎没有差距——就是同一批人。国内人才是不缺的。人才短缺是阶段性的，历史上从来没有长期缺某一类人的情况。
